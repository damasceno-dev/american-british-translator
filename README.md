# Personal notes
make sure all tests has the keepOpen() method. This way, the project will go back up after running the tests.
make sure that the response is returning the translated text envolved by <span class="highlight", with double quotes, or fcc tests wont pass.
for debugging fcc tests, you can open dev tools and check the console where the error is at, and insert a break point at the assertion method.
